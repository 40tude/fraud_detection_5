## Description

- My first attempt to use [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and SDD.
- The application simulates a fraud detection system
    - Transactions are generated by Provider and written in Buffer1
    - Consumer extracts the transactions, send them to the Modelizer which returns inferred_transaction
    - On return, for each fraudulent inferred_transaction an alarm is sent
    - inferred_transaction are written in Buffer2
    - Logger extract inferred_transaction and writes pending_transaction in Storage
        - pending_transaction is a inferred_transaction + prediction_confirmed field which will be set once the transaction will be checked
        - doing so, Storage's content can be used to train a ML model with recent data
- Extractions and Writes operate on batches of transactions
    - Batches size vary
    - Speeds are all different
- The application is a modular monolith
- Every component
    - use an hexagonal architecture
    - DIP is used to decouple components from implementation of buffers and storage
    - Run asynchronously (tokio)
    - Use thiserror
